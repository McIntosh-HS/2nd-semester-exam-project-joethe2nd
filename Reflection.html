                My feelings on the course overall are positive with no complaints whatsoever.
                I deeply enoyed learning about the terminal and other practicle uses for coding.
                Nothing went wrong and I cant wait to learn about more in the future.

                Html, java, css, and c are all useful and I'm excited to learn about python and c++ later.
                The karel unit was entertaining as I learned about for loops and while loops.
